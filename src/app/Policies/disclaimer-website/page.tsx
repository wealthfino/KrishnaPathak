              I do not provide any promise or assurance of favourable view for a
              particular industry or sector or business group in any manner. The
              investor is requested to take into consideration all the risk

              I or any other person related to me might be holding positions in

            <li>
              The research recommendations are provided to all our clients who
              are entitled to receive the research reports. Any Client (Paid or
              Unpaid), any third party or anyone else have no rights to forward
              or share our calls or SMS or Reports or Any Information Provided

              actions can be taken.
            </li>

            <li>
              I ensure that the individuals employed as research analyst are
              separate from other employees who are performing sales trading,
              dealing, corporate finance advisory or any other activity that may
              affect the independence of our research report/ recommendations.
              However, these individuals may receive feedback from sales or
              trading personnel of brokerage division to ascertain the impact of
              research report/ recommendations.
            </li>

            <li>
              I also ensure that if a client wants an opinion on a specific
              position, such suggestion/ view under any circumstances shall be
              considered as an opinion (not advice). I am not liable for any
              losses whatsoever the client may incur in accepting this opinion.
            </li>

            <li>
              I do not have any association in any manner with any issuer of
              products/securities; this ensures that there are no actual or
              potential conflicts of interest. This also ensures that
              objectivity or independence in the carrying on research services
              is not compromised.

            <li>
              Stock trading is inherently risky, and you agree to assume
              complete and full responsibility for the outcomes of all trading
              decisions that you make.
            </li>

            <li>
              Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not
              represent actual trading. No representation is being made that any
              account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to
              those shown.

            <li>
              You, and not me, assume the entire cost and risk of any trading
              you choose to undertake. You are solely responsible for making
              your own investment decisions. If you choose to engage in
              transactions with or without seeking advice from a licensed and
              qualified financial advisor or entity, then such decision and any
              consequences flowing therefrom are your sole responsibility. I or
              any employees are in no way liable for the use of the information
              by others in investing or trading in investment vehicles.

            <li>
              I also encourage all investors to use the services as a resource
              to further their own research on all featured companies, stocks,
